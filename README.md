# As of Feb 7, 2024 the Earth View website is offline.
The [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh) is still active, so this may have been a mistake. For records sake this repo serves as a backup of the image asset URLs for easy access.

# Earth View by Google

Earth View is a collection of the most beautiful and striking landscapes found in Google Earth.

Note: I get the whole list though this script (https://github.com/alexpersian/earthview/blob/master/script/parser.py) and the list is available here or in JSON format (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexpersian/earthview/master/earthview.json)
